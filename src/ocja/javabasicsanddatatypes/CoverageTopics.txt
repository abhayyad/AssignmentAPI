1. PrimitiveDataTypes - 

char var = 10;  // this is a valid statement
char uses 16 bits (2 Bytes) and its range is 0 to 65535 (no signed bit reserved) 
so it can easily store value 10.

// size (Number) : byte < short < int < long < float < double
// size char and mum(starting int) : char < int < long < float < double
	      
// +++++++Rules for above two+++++
// small data type  assigned to higher data type is OK
// higher data type assigned to lower data type is not OK , 
//                    has to be type-casted to lower data type.
// char , short and byte has to type casted to each other if need to be assigned
